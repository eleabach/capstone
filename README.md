# capstone

This repository contains code for our Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health HDS Capstone course, which is on Building a Feature Store for Dana Farber Cancer Institute. 

There are three notebooks in this repository : 
- **EDA.ipynb**, which contains code to perform EDA of the MIMIC-III dataset, which we used to inform our decisions as to the architecture and features of our feature store.
- **database_schema.ipynb**, which contains code to generate the json files to define our database.
- **text_embeddings.ipynb**, which contains our Python class to generate different types of text embeddings (using word2vec and HuggingFace transformers models)
